# my-virtual-pet
This virtual pet game allows the player to interact with Marty the Sloth in various ways. A menu first pops us notifying the options on activities available. Marty's hunger and/or thirst levels should not exceed 100. If it does, Marty dies. The player can feed, make him drink water,play with him, as well as put him to sleep. Marty's age will increment by 1 every time the player chooses a new activity from the menu. If age exceeds 50, Marty will die!
Special mention:
The Tick method increments the age of of the animal as well as general health
status such as hunger and thirst of the animal if the appropriate action does not take place while an activity is completed. It will eventually lead the animal to perish and the game will be over.
I hope you enjoy the game and let me know any feedback!
Thanks!
